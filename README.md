# Project for the Sliding Modes Lecture

## Stabilization of underactuated systems using sliding surfaces

1. If it's necessary linearize the plant along the **unstable** equilibrium point.
2. Look if the system is controlable using the controlability matrix.
3. Transform the system intro the Canonical Controlable Form.
4. Design the following surfaces:
    - Singular LQ Design of first order.
    - Singular LQ Design of second order.
    - Singular LQ Design of third order.
    - Ackermann Formula Design of first order.
    - Ackermann Formula Design of second order.
    - Ackermann Formula Design of third order.
5. Simulate and use for each surface a discontinuous sliding mode controller, and a continuous sliding one. Also simulate and solve the stabilization using 4th order controllers. 
6. Write a report showing all the results, with a extensive discussion about them.

Note: In total there are 14 cases to be solved.
